To use the service just spin it up.

You can use swagger for testing. First create a new user if not already created. 
Then call the authenticate API user/authenticate with the user credentials and you will get back a token.
You should than copy the token and press the authenticate button in swagger and paste it (don't foget to add Bearer before the token). 
You are now authenticated and can call the apis.
